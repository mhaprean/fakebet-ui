# Fake bet

This is a game app built for fun, that replicates a real sports betting website.
Users can register, and they will receive a fake 10.000$ in their game account, to play around.
The idea is to predict game outcomes without losing money on a real betting agency.
My theory is that is almost impossible to have profit on long term by betting. But you can train here without losing money
